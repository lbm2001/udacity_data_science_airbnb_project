## 1 Installation
All libraries used in this code should be used in the standard Anaconda distribution of Python.
The Python version used writing the code was 3.9, therefore there should be no issues with running the code
using Python version 3.*.

## 2 Project Motivation
During the course of this projects we will use data from AirBnB locations in Boston and Seattle of 2021 to answer
different research questions. I was interested if the **price** of a location...

1. ... is higher if its located in certain neighbourhoods?
2. ... is higher if it has a certain property type?
3. ... is higher if it accommodates more persons?
4. ... is higher if it has more beds/bedrooms?
5. ... is lower if it misses some of the omse common amenities?

Additionally I wanted to know if the **review score** of a location...

1. ... is higher if the host response more frequently?
2. ... is higher if the host accepts more requests?
3. ... is lower if the host is no superhost?
4. ... is higher if the host has a profile pic?

Based on the data I also built an prediction model for prices of AirBnB locations.

## 3 File descriptions
This repository contains on jupyter notebook that contains the work related to answer the formulated research questions.
The structure is based on the CRISP-DM Data Science process - additional markdown cells are included for further explanation.

Additionally the two .csv files containing the AirBnB data from Boston and Seattle are included.

## 4 Results
The answers to the research questions and the main findings can be found [here](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/how-much-is-your-property-worth-on-airbnb-542bc285dfa).
